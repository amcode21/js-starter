# Instructions

Alright, so let's get started on this tutorial on how to code a timer

## Preparation
- Make sure you have a text editor or IDE to work with that has syntax highlighting

## Steps
1) We're gonna need a few files
	- `index.html`
	- `index.js`
	- `style.css`

2) Alright, so now we have our files - let's get to work!

3) So to start off, we want to first define our `index.html` document as an HTML document
	- ```html
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<html>
			<head>
			</head>
			<!--We declared our head and our body-->
			<body>
			</body>
		</html>
	  ```
